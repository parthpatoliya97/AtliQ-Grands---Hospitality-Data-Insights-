## Problem Statement

- AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

## ✅ Final Strategic Recommendations for AtliQ Grands

### 1️⃣ Implement Smart Dynamic Pricing (High Impact – Immediate Revenue Lift)

#### Problem: ADR remained flat across all weeks, meaning zero dynamic pricing → major revenue leakage.

Solution :

- Introduce seasonal, event-driven, and weekday/weekend pricing.

- Benchmark ADR against competitors, occupancy forecasts, and demand curves.

- Deploy AI-/rule-based pricing engine to optimize ADR & RevPAR in real time.

#### Add premium pricing on :

- High-demand weekends (already 62% occupancy)

- Festive periods & city events

- Sold-out room classes like Elite/Presidential


## 2️⃣ Reduce High Cancellation Rate (Currently 24–25%)

### Problem: 33K cancellations causing ₹199M revenue loss.

Solution:

- Launch non-refundable discounted rates for price-sensitive travelers.

- Apply strict cancellation rules during high-occupancy weeks.

- Use automated WhatsApp/SMS/email reminders 24-48 hours before check-in.

- Introduce a prepayment model for peak seasons.


## 3️⃣ Boost Direct Bookings (Reduce OTA Dependency)

### Problem: Only 7K direct offline bookings, while OTAs dominate (40%+ share).

Solution:

- Launch a Direct Booking Loyalty Program with points, free breakfast, upgrades.

- Offer website-exclusive discounts & early check-in benefits.

- Run Google Ads + social retargeting to pull customers from OTAs.

- Improve the brand website’s UX, speed, and mobile booking experience.


## 4️⃣ Strengthen Low-Performing Cities & Hotels

### Hyderabad (Lower ADR, Lower RevPAR) / Delhi (High Occupancy but Lowest Revenue)

- Launch corporate tie-ups for weekday business bookings.

- Create value-driven weekday corporate packages.

- Improve digital marketing around local events & weekends.

### AtliQ Seasons (Revenue lowest, rating 2.3)

- Immediate service quality audit.

- Refurbish rooms, update amenities & housekeeping standards.

- Launch targeted promotions to rebuild trust.

- Expected Outcome: rise in occupancy, improved online rating (target ≥3.5).


## 5️⃣ Optimise Underperforming Room Classes (Standard & Business)

### Problem: Standard rooms have lowest ADR, RevPAR & highest cancellations.

Solution:

Reposition Standard category through:

- Complimentary breakfast

- Flexible check-out

- Family packages

- Meal-inclusive bundles

- Improve in-room features to increase perceived value.



## 6️⃣ Weekend Revenue Maximization

### Insight: Weekends show higher Occupancy (62%) but flat pricing → missed potential.

Solution:

Introduce curated weekend premium packages:

- Couple stays

- Spa/meal bundles

- Local city tour tie-ups

- Increase ADR on high-demand weekends.


## 7️⃣ Control OTA Dependence & Analyze “Others” Category

### Problem: “Others” channel generates ~41% bookings but is undefined → opaque strategy.

Solution:

- Identify sources in the “Others” bucket (agents? corporate? third-party apps?).

- Negotiate commission rates.

- Shift volume to direct website by offering lower prices & loyalty incentives.

Expected Outcome: Clear channel strategy + reduced cost of acquisition.
